Project for the course DA3018

To run the full program with output graphs follow instructions at top of translate_data.sh

Results, graphs, time/space complexity and discussion about algorithms used is found in report.md. 

The labnotes are organized per day and discusses algorithm ideas, test, debugging etc.

In the data folder: 
Result_million.txt file which is the output from the Java program with number of components with at least three vertices, component densities and node distribution. The other two files are the same result, just divided into two txt-files to be able to generate the histograms without executing the shell script.
